Create a wordlist using wordlist_creator.py
    Remember this creates all possible combination of the given charecter list so make sure you detail your list and make it short as possible through social enginnering.
    *Even a wordlist of 5 letters have a length of 78,000,00 so be sure to minimize and put your effort in making wordlist of your own

Then run the main file
    There supply the Course URL For ex.https://www.udemy.com/automate/ and then the price of the original course For ex. 12,480 (Dont forget commas)
    You are ready to go
    It will try all the combo and you can leave it to run

**If your wordlist is of length 6 and it can cause your PC to hang a bit and a tremendous time to get the brute force done.
I suggest you to make wordlist of your own and if you are facing difficulty you can still use my wordlist creator
